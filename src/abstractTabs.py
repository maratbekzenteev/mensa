# AbstractTabs is a class that represents navigation elements made of tabs
# As stated in the name, this class is abstract, i.e. should not be instantiated,
# an instance of one of the subclasses should be used instead.
# It conceptually differs from Grid in the way selected cells are handled
# AbstractClass distinguishes two properties of a cell (here: a tab): opened and active
# While the active cell is deactivated each time the grid itself is,
# an opened cell stays open even if the grid is deactivated
# This enables the user to see what was selected previously without the need to reselect it now
# Unlike a Grid, AbstractTabs calculates its offset depending
# on self.opened_cell instead of self.active_cell
# It also sets self.active_cell to self.opened_cell (instead of (0, 0))
# when the grid is newly selected
# AbstractTabs behaves in such a way that a cell may not be active without being opened,
# though it is technically possible to make it that way
# Attributes:
# - self.opened_cell - (int, int), coordinates of the opened grid cell
